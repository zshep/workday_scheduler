# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

The workDay scheduler shows the workday in a nice neat organized manner. The workscheduler will automatically update the workspace showing what times have already past, what times are yet to come and what the current hour is using color codes.

The user can click and save an event based on the time when it is entered into.
